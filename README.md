# Basketball Project
### Purpose
This purpose of this project is to solve the hypothesis that certain basketball players perform better or worse during the playoffs. Certain examples would include 
Paul George, who was given nicknames like "Playoff P" and "Pandemic P" for his lackluster performance during the 2020 playoffs, as well as Lebron James, who numerous players label
as the hardest obstacle to get over, especially during his time on the East Coast.

In addition, this project would help strengthen my Python skills, specifically the use of Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib towards Data Science projects. 
### Skills used
This program was primarily written in Python, however I had also used Excel and a scrapper to obtain proper statistics that could feed into Pandas DataFrames and Numpy Arrays.
